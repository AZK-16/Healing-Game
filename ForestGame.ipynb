    "The dice roll result, variables of type plant and healing points are passed as arguments. If the dice roll is less than or equal to 3, the first branch is followed. If the result is 4 or 5, the second branch is followed. If the result is 6, the last branch is followed. The harder it is to obtain a dice roll result, the more points associated with the plant e.g. plant3 has 5 points because it is much harder to roll a 6 than, for instance, plant1 which has 3 points as there's a higher chance of rolling a 1,2 or 3 than exactly 6. In each of the branches, the updatePointsAfterMysteryBox is called to increase the healing points then this updated value is returned."
